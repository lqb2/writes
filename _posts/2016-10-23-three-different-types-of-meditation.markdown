earlier this week i was reading [resilience](resiliencethebook.com) and something blew my mind. the chapter is entitled 'the resilient mind' and, somewhat obviously, meditation came up. the section introed with descriptions of three different types of meditation. 

i was in a reading flow so i didn't stop, but since then i've looked up more information on the different types. i think had sensed and heard from friends (mostly danielle) that there were different types of meditation. but never did i think they fit so neatly into categories with such clear boundaries and specific benefits. 

[this post](https://www.mum.edu/academic-departments/maharishi-vedic-science/mvs-topics/three-types-of-meditation/) on the maharishi university of management's website explains the differences resonably well (maybe not *that* well, though). it does include this somewhat helpful graphic:

![three types of meditation](https://www.mum.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Three-Categories-of-Meditation31250.png)

it's not a particularly beautiful graphic, but academic/university graphics haven't really ever been. maybe i'll remake it someday. 

anyway, what's hitting me right now is that the three different types have different impacts. focused attention (like zen and vipassana), open monitoring (like mindfulness), and loving-kindness/automatic self-transcending (i don't really understand this one and don't have any good examples) all seem to have different methods and impacts.

i'm think what i'm coming to realize here is that there's much more to meditation than i expected. 

awesome. let the journey begin (continue)!
