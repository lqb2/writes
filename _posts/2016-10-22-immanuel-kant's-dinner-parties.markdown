one of the projects i'm most excited right now is called called big talk [link coming someday]. it's an anti-small talk discussion group where we talk about a big question without trying to find an answer. it gets surprisingly deep quickly and i usually come away feeling encouraged (about humanity). i also usually learn or learn about things (sometimes crazy stuff like [this experiment about water, good thoughts, and crystals](http://www.masaru-emoto.net/english/water-crystal.html) which has been soundly criticized [over here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaru_Emoto#Scientific_criticism)).

last week, i went on a walk (as i enjoy doing) with my friend kate. during our catching up, i was telling her about big talk. she told me that it reminded her of immanuel kant's dinner parties. they are described in a book called '[the last days of kant.](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/d/de_quincey/thomas/last-days-of-immanuel-kant/)' i also googled it and found a few blog posts on the topic. this one from [on scenes of eating](https://scenesofeating.com/2015/11/12/kants-dinner-party/) was the best.

now, i don't know a ton about kant, but i know he taught a lot and was a philosopher. it wasn't totally surprising to me that he would have dinner parties. it was surprising to me what rules he believed made up a good dinner conversation. they are eerily similar to the structures we're trying to build around big talk. 

i've included the rules (edited by the scenes of eating blogger) below, but basically what i'm trying to say is that there is nothing new under the sun. 

## kant's dinner discussion rules:

1. A dinner party should not only supply physical satisfaction–which everyone can find for himself–but also social enjoyment for which the dinner must appear only as a vehicle.
1. A dinner party should have at least 3 guests so that the conversation is not too intense, but at most 9 so as to avoid breaking into smaller groups.
1. Choose your guests carefully; i.e. by the four humors. The best dinner companions are those with sanguine or phlegmatic temperaments: they tend to be jovial and easygoing respectively. Choleric diners will be polite guests, but don’t invite two of them, as they are likely to argue. Try not to invite melancholic guests if you can help it.
1. Eating together presupposes a covenant of security. Your guests assume they are safe at your table, and it becomes a duty of the host to guarantee it.
1. Mind your manners. Good etiquette at the table promotes a virtuous disposition by at least making virtue fashionable.
1. Since, unlike animals, we have the ability to choose what we consume, it is crucial to eat well and appropriately to our bodily needs. Excessive ingestion of food or drink hampers the judgment and goes against the duties to the self.
1. However, wine loosens the tongue and opens the heart. So, for the sake of sociability, it is permissible to cross the line of sobriety for a short time. Just with wine, though. Beer makes guests rude and brandy turns them silent.
1. There should be three stages of dinner table conversation to refresh the power of a man of learning: narration (sharing the news of the day), debate, and jesting. Reasoning is a kind of work, and it becomes more difficult after eating copiously; thus, as the dinner winds down, the conversation will naturally turn to play–and laughter, in turn, will aid digestion.
1. The duty of secrecy is incumbent on both guests and hosts; indiscretion and gossip are not permissible in the context of dinner parties.
1. Discuss topics of common interest. Your personal life and business are inappropriate topics. Anthropology, arguments about moral worth, and current affairs are okay.
1. Invite women. Without them, social intercourse is unrefined, turbulent, and unsociable. In a society of nothing but men, one degenerates into conflict, a know-it-all attitude, and quarrelling, but that is not the case in the society of women.
1. All of the above is effective only if the dinner is not adulterated by entertainments which preclude sociable conversation and promote the opposite of virtue: music, dance or–worst of all–games.
